# Day03

Decided to give elixir a go today

Had a look at some other peoples solutions after where they built a 1000x1000 array or arrays then for each rectangle appended it's id to the cells it covered. A lot simpler

My solution was to convert the areas of the rectangles to sets of {x,y} coordinates and do intersection / disjoint checks

I'll be interested to follow the video that Jose Valim eventually puts up - first one was very helpful as he spent lots of time explaining why he was structuring stuff and how it could be different

Might copy them and try in ruby tomorrow on the train to London
