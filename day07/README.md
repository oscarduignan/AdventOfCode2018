# Day07

This broke my brain, and I looked at lots of DFS / topological search algorithms (new to me) but I couldn't translate it to the way I needed to structure things in elixir. Then sat down with this again today and managed to make it click in my head and came up with something I'm even quite happy with the structure of.
