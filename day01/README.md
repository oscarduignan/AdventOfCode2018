# Day01

[challenge.js] was my first attempt at this, I tried using https://alfie.prodo.ai but my browser wasn't a good environment to run this code in. I hit some issues where I was forgetting about quirks of for-in loops on arrays in javascript and the mutability of certain operations on arrays.

```
oscar@laptop ~/L/M/c/P/A/day01> time node challenge.js
...

        0.33 real         0.16 user         0.14 sys
```

[challenge-rx.js] was just because I'm trying to refresh my rxjs skills.

```
oscar@laptop ~/L/M/c/P/A/day01> time node challenge-rx.js
...

        0.47 real         0.33 user         0.16 sys
